# Explore the imports and modules

There are severals ways to run a python script.  This code lets you experiment
with it.  Try running the script as a module or as a script,  also try running
it from this directory or from somewhere else.  Once the script stops in the
pdb debugger.  Try looking at special variables like `__spec__`, `__name__`
and `sys.path`.   Also try importing submodule `x` and see when it works and
when it doesn't.
